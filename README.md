In this project, I'm going to build a private chain of ethereum on Windows.
There will be 4 nodes as normal node and miner on this private chain that is using PoW for consensus.

## Enviroment

First, you should install [Geth(Go Ethereum)](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/) for running a full ethereum node.

Be notice that there is a *checkbox named Development tool* you should checked during the installation.

Now you are able to type **geth --help** on CMD or Bash to get help information for Geth.
